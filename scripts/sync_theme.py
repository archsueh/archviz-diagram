"""Sync the shared theme block (_archviz-theme.html) into every HTML template.

Why this script fails loudly
----------------------------
It used the same implicit-silence pattern as `sync_export.py`: a template that
lacked the `<style id="archviz-theme-vars">` anchor was skipped without a word.
`network-topology.html` was the victim — it referenced 11 distinct `--av-*`
variables across 40 call sites while defining none of them, so every colour and
the page background fell back to nothing, and nothing ever reported it.

A template is now skipped only if it is in EXCLUDED, or in THEME_EXEMPT with a
stated reason. A missing anchor anywhere else is an error and exits non-zero.
