# archviz

Restrained 2D information visualization skill pack for AI agents.

Every visualization starts with a **brief read** and **three dials** — not a default template.

> **3D spatial visualization** has been split into [archviz-3d](https://github.com/archsueh/archviz-3d).

## What this is

A skill for AI agents (Claude Code, Hermes, Codex, etc.) that generates **rational, minimalist, restrained visualizations**. Not just Mermaid — supports ASCII/termaid terminal rendering, self-contained HTML, Python (Plotly), Obsidian Canvas, draw.io handoff guidance, and Three.js 3D archviz.

## Design philosophy

`archviz-skills` treats every diagram as a small **DESIGN.md artifact**: a plain-text design contract that an agent can read, execute, and audit. The goal is not to make diagrams prettier by default; the goal is to make their visual language explicit enough that another agent can reproduce the same taste without guessing.

Every output should expose five things:

| Layer | What it answers | Required evidence |
|---|---|---|
| Atmosphere | What should this feel like? | Palette + density + restraint |
| Tokens | What exact values are allowed? | Hex values, line weights, type scale |
| Components | What recurring pieces exist? | Nodes, arrows, legends, labels |
| Layout | How does information collapse? | Direction, caps, fallbacks |
| Guardrails | What must never happen? | Anti-patterns + validation gates |

This is adapted from the `awesome-design-md` pattern: `DESIGN.md` is the visual truth source, `SKILL.md` is the execution protocol, and examples prove the contract works.

**Core principles:**
- Brief-first, anti-slop
- Text-first, preview-compatible
- One accent max, contrast-checked
- Environment-aware (Obsidian / terminal / deliverables / 3D)
- Editable-handoff aware (`.drawio` guidance when Mermaid is not enough)
- Design-contract first: no template ships without tokens, intent, constraints, and validation notes

**Mode routing:**
- **Default (2D infoviz)** — charts, flowcharts, gantt, sankey, tables, teaching diagrams
- **3D archviz** — only when the brief mentions building, floorplan, structure, section cut, or walkthrough (`templates/html/threejs-*.html`)
- **Editable handoff** — use draw.io mode when the user needs a diagram that can be edited by architects, teachers, or engineering teams after generation

## Design system

[DESIGN.md](DESIGN.md) follows the Stitch DESIGN.md 9-section format (per [awesome-design-md](https://github.com/VoltAgent/awesome-design-md)):

1. Visual Theme & Atmosphere (+ Agent-Readable Contract)
2. Color Palette & Roles — semantic names + hex + role, 5 palette systems, luminance contrast gate
3. Typography Rules (越大越细 hierarchy)
4. Component Stylings — nodes, edges, groups, gantt, tables, Mermaid init
5. Layout Principles — three dials + whitespace philosophy
6. Depth & Elevation — flat by doctrine
7. Do's and Don'ts
8. Responsive Behavior + degradation strategy
9. Agent Prompt Guide — quick color reference + ready-to-use prompts

Extended sections: visualization taxonomy (Few + Shneiderman), Aver signature patterns, 3D archviz (Three.js + animejs), draw.io handoff rules, terminal routing, scene contracts, validation gates.

[preview.html](preview.html) is the visual catalog (swatches, type scale, node/edge vocabulary) — open it in a browser.
